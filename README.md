# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Cloud-Images

Rainfall prediction using cloud images leverages advanced image processing and machine learning to forecast precipitation. 

The process involves:

Data Collection: High-resolution cloud images are captured via satellites and ground-based cameras.
Image Preprocessing: Images are normalized and noise is reduced to enhance clarity.
Feature Extraction: Key features like texture, shape, size, and color of clouds are analyzed.
Machine Learning: A model, often a convolutional neural network (CNN), is trained on historical data to predict rainfall from new images.
Validation: Predictions are compared with actual rainfall data for accuracy and the model is regularly recalibrated.

Applications include weather forecasting, agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning, providing accurate, efficient, and cost-effective predictions. Challenges include the need for high-quality data, significant computational resources, and ensuring model generalization across diverse regions and conditions.
